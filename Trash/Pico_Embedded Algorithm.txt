1. The pico inputs data through the USB interface one after the other with each interrupt till buffer. Ideally through the ADC.
2. The pico buffers 15 seconds of 200hz data into a list
2.5. During the following steps, each interrupt of USB interfaced data causes the next buffer of same size as above to be filled.
3. The data_list undergoes the Pan-Tompkins algorithm
4. The Classification parameter is estimated 
5. Data is classified and displayed.
